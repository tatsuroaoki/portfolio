						<p class="blog-content blog-content-beginning">One of the most important things to consider in web development is to ensure that when people visit your website, user experience isn't compromised regardless of the device being used. In other words, whether Ellen is using her computer at home or her iPhone to access your website, her experience shouldn’t be any different.</p>

						<p class="blog-content">Have you ever visited a website that you enjoyed visiting on your desktop, but once you tried to do the same on your phone, the website was wacky and made you hate it? This is a result of a website with bad responsive design. As the term suggests, responsive design is a web development technique in making websites adaptable to different display environments. As a designer you can’t assume that your visitors will always be using a specific device, browser, window size, and so on. The more assumptions you make about your end users when designing a website, the more rigid your website becomes and that is an easy way to make your product repulsive, even if the content is desirable. </p>
